when every you want to start a new project no worries about login sign up like basic stuffs and folder structure 
everything in one just add .env file with 
#JWT_SECRET 
#MONGODB_URI
#NODE_ENV 
and run in both folder /backend , /frontend 
#npm i && npm run dev 
if there is any problem with frontend installments ->run this 
_> # npm i --legacy-peer-deps 
_> # npm run dev
